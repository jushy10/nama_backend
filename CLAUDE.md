# nama_backend — architecture & conventions

A lightweight **FastAPI** backend. Code is organized as a **clean-architecture
vertical slice** (Robert C. Martin's "Clean Architecture"): each feature lives
in its own package under `app/`, split into layers that depend *inward* only.

The stocks feature (`app/stocks/`) is the reference implementation. Every new
feature should mirror its layering. If something here disagrees with the code,
the code wins — fix this file.

## The one rule: dependencies point inward

**The flow:** `endpoint → use case → entities`, and the use case pulls data by
calling an **adapter through a port**.

**The dependency rule** — an inner layer must never import an outer one:

| Layer | File(s) | May import | Must NOT import |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Entities | `entities.py`, `indicators.py` | stdlib only (`dataclasses`, `datetime`, `enum`) | anything else in `app/`, FastAPI, pydantic, any vendor SDK |
| Ports | `ports.py` | entities, stdlib `abc` | use cases, adapters, framework, vendors |
| Use cases | `use_cases.py` | entities, ports, exceptions, pure-domain helpers (`indicators.py`) | adapters (concrete providers), FastAPI, pydantic, any vendor SDK |
| Adapters | `*_provider.py`, `adapters/*_adapter.py` | entities, ports, exceptions, **+ the vendor SDK / `httpx` / SQLAlchemy** | other adapters, use cases, FastAPI, pydantic |
| DTOs | `schemas.py` | pydantic only | entities, use cases, adapters |
| Router (composition root) | `router.py` | **everything** — use cases, ports, concrete adapters, schemas, exceptions, `db`, FastAPI | — |

> The use case depends on the **port** (an `ABC`), never the concrete adapter.
> That inversion is the whole point: the core never imports a vendor — the
> vendor imports the core. It's also what lets every test run offline against a
> hand-written fake. Never shortcut it by importing a `*_provider` into a use
> case or an entity.

## The layers

### 1. Entities — `app/stocks/entities.py`
*Enterprise Business Rules.* Pure domain objects: frozen `@dataclass`es and
`Enum`s that model the concepts (`Stock`, `Quote`, `Candle`, `AnalystEstimates`,
…). They import nothing from the rest of the app.

Business logic that is **a fact about one entity** lives here, as a `@property`
or `@classmethod` — computed on access, not stored:
- `Stock.change` / `change_percent` / `spread`
- `Candle.is_bullish` (the green/red rule)
- `KeyMetrics.peg`, `AnalystEstimates.forward_pe(price)`
- the slices' `QuarterlyEarnings.beat` and `*Timeline.filled_from(...)` (pure merge logic)

Entities are vendor-agnostic on purpose: e.g. `Timeframe` defines business-level
granularities; the adapter maps them onto whatever the vendor calls them.

Pure cross-entity calculations with no I/O (e.g. the EMA / support-level math in
`indicators.py`) are also domain code — they live next to the entities, import
only entities, and never reach out for data.

### 2. Ports — `app/stocks/ports.py`
The abstractions a use case depends on. Each is an `ABC` with `@abstractmethod`s
phrased in domain terms (`get_stock`, `get_quotes`, `get_estimates`,
`all`). They return **entities** and document which **domain exceptions** they
raise. One port per capability — keep them small so an adapter can implement
exactly the ones it covers (`AlpacaStockDataProvider` implements seven).

Naming: a live feed is a `*Provider`; static reference data is a `*Repository`.

### 3. Use cases — `app/stocks/use_cases.py`
*Application Business Rules.* One class per action, constructor-injected with the
ports it needs, exposing a single `execute(...)`:

```python
class GetStockInfo:
    def __init__(self, provider: StockDataProvider, ...): ...
    def execute(self, symbol: str) -> Stock: ...
```

A use case: validates/normalizes input (`_normalize_symbol`), calls ports,
assembles entities, applies enrichment, and enforces multi-source orchestration
(the earnings context in `GetStockAnalysis`). It depends
only on entities + ports — never a framework, never a concrete provider.

> **Latency orchestration (the AI-analysis path).** `GetStockAnalysis` /
> `GetEtfAnalysis` are the slice's slowest calls — a multi-source gather feeding a
> Bedrock model call. Three deliberate levers keep them fast: (1) a **read-through
> result cache** (the `analysis/` sub-slice) short-circuits the whole thing for a
> stored read still within `ANALYSIS_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES`; (2) the best-effort
> context is read **DB-only** (via `db_only_context_providers`) so a cache miss
> never triggers a synchronous, rate-limited Yahoo fetch inside the request; and (3)
> `GetStockInfo` gathers its independent enrichment reads **concurrently** (a
> `ThreadPoolExecutor` over the Alpaca/Finnhub calls — the DB estimates read stays on
> the calling thread, since the request `Session` isn't thread-safe). Using stdlib
> `concurrent.futures` for I/O fan-out is still just orchestration — no framework or
> vendor leaks into the core.

### 4. Adapters — `app/stocks/*_provider.py`, `app/stocks/adapters/*_adapter.py`
*Interface Adapters.* Each implements a port and is **the only module that knows
a given vendor exists**. It translates the vendor's SDK/HTTP/ORM models into our
entities, and the vendor's failures into our domain exceptions. Swap vendors and
only this one file changes.

> Most adapters still sit flat in `app/stocks/` as `<vendor>_<concern>_provider.py`.
> The earnings adapters live in `app/stocks/adapters/` and are named `*_adapter.py`
> (the yfinance live sources, their DB-cache decorators, and the estimates projection);
> the AI-analysis adapters are grouped in `app/stocks/adapters/bedrock/` (all five
> Claude-on-Bedrock analysers — stock / ETF / earnings / sector / market); other
> features' adapters can migrate there over time.

- `alpaca_provider.py` — Alpaca SDK → price/quote/candles/performance/sectors, plus the batched board feed (`BulkQuoteProvider.get_quotes` — many symbols' day-change in one chunked snapshot call, best-effort per symbol; backs the heat map)
- `finnhub_*_provider.py` — Finnhub → fundamentals (market cap, dividend, ratios, margins) / company name (`/stock/profile2`)
- `logodev_provider.py` — Logo.dev → logo image
- `caching_company_profile_provider.py` — decorator adapter (wraps another adapter to add an in-process TTL cache; same port in, same port out)
- `adapters/yfinance_quarterly_earnings_adapter.py` — live source for the quarterly-earnings slice: **Yahoo via `yfinance`**, building the 4-recent + up-to-2-upcoming quarter timeline. **Past** quarters come from `earnings_dates` (reported EPS vs the estimate that preceded it; surprise computed here, not from Yahoo's `Surprise(%)`). **Upcoming** quarters come from the `0q`/`+1q` rows of `earnings_estimate` + `revenue_estimate` — the reliable source of *two* forward quarters (EPS + revenue), so a stock surfaces both even when `earnings_dates` lists only one scheduled future date; a scheduled date is attached when it lines up. **Reported revenue** (`revenue_actual`) is matched onto the past quarters from `quarterly_income_stmt` (Total Revenue, whose columns carry the *true* fiscal period-end dates: each quarter takes the column most recently preceding its announcement date — never the calendar-derived label, which for off-calendar filers like MU names a different fiscal quarter than the EPS) — best-effort enrichment, so a failure fetching it drops the actual without sinking the timeline. Fiscal labels are derived from the announcement date (calendar best-effort; the offset is cosmetic — a row's EPS and revenue always belong to the same fiscal quarter). **Currency (foreign ADRs):** a shared `adapters/yfinance_currency.py` normalizer maps a foreign issuer's figures onto its **trading** currency (USD) so one timeline doesn't splice currencies ~32× apart (TWD) — `quarterly_income_stmt` revenue is reliably reporting-currency (converted by the FX rate), while the *market* EPS surfaces (`earnings_dates` and `earnings_estimate`) are quoted per-ADR in a currency that **varies by issuer** (USD for TSM, the reporting currency CNY for BABA), so their currency is *detected once* from the `0y` estimate against the trading-currency `info['forwardEps']` and applied uniformly; identity (no-op) for a US issuer or when the FX rate is unavailable (best-effort, never-worse). `adapters/db_cached_quarterly_earnings_adapter.py` — a **read-through** DB cache in front of it: serves stored rows if present, else fetches from Yahoo **once on a miss** and stores. **No TTL/staleness or serve-stale**; a populated symbol is always served straight from the DB, and keeping rows current is entirely the cron's job
- `adapters/yfinance_annual_earnings_adapter.py` — live source for the annual-earnings slice: **Yahoo via `yfinance`**, building the 4-recent + up-to-2-upcoming *fiscal-year* timeline (the yearly analogue of the quarterly adapter). **Past** years come from `income_stmt` (annual) — `Diluted EPS` (falling back to `Basic EPS`) as the actual, plus `Total Revenue` and `Net Income`. **Upcoming** years come from the `0y`/`+1y` rows of `earnings_estimate` + `revenue_estimate` (EPS + revenue) — Yahoo's forward ceiling (so ≤2). Forward years are labelled by `info['nextFiscalYearEnd']` (0y), falling back to one year past the latest reported year. **No annual surprise/beat** — Yahoo's estimate-vs-actual history is per-quarter, so a reported year carries an actual with no estimate. Reported years also carry `eps_actual_consensus` — the year's actual EPS on the **analyst-consensus (adjusted) basis**, i.e. the sum of its four quarterly "Reported EPS" values from a deeper `get_earnings_dates` fetch (quarters assigned to a fiscal year by their derived calendar quarter-end falling within the year ending at the true fiscal-year-end; summed only when all four slots are filled, else `None`). It exists because `eps_actual` (GAAP diluted) and the forward `eps_estimate` (adjusted consensus) are on different bases — a client anchoring a P/E walk needs both ends on one basis. Best-effort enrichment, like revenue. Key caveat: `income_stmt` is the **fundamentals endpoint Yahoo IP-gates hardest from data-centre IPs** (intermittently — prod has fetched it successfully), so it's fetched best-effort: a blocked fetch drops the reported years but leaves the forward ones, and the **merge-preserving sync** keeps the stored reported rows when that happens. **Currency (foreign ADRs):** the same shared `adapters/yfinance_currency.py` normalizer maps a foreign issuer onto its **trading** currency — `income_stmt` (EPS/revenue/net income) + `revenue_estimate` are reliably reporting-currency (converted by the FX rate), while the *market* EPS surfaces (`earnings_estimate` **and** the `earnings_dates`-summed `eps_actual_consensus`) ride the *detected* market rate (see the quarterly bullet); this is what stops a TWD-reporting ADR from serving an `eps_actual` of 331 next to a forward estimate of 16. `adapters/db_cached_annual_earnings_adapter.py` — the same **read-through** DB cache as quarterly (DB-first, fetch-on-miss, no TTL/serve-stale)
- `adapters/annual_earnings_estimates_adapter.py` — implements the `AnalystEstimatesProvider` port by **projecting the annual-earnings slice's stored forward years** into an `AnalystEstimates` block (first upcoming year → FY1, next → FY2); it feeds the enriched stock snapshot (`GetStockInfo`, now the AI analysis context — the standalone `GET /stocks/{symbol}` endpoint was removed). **DB-only, no live fall-through**: estimates are best-effort enrichment, so an uncached symbol just omits the forward metrics until the annual read path (lazy fill) or its cron populates the rows. This replaced the dedicated `stock_analyst_estimates` table + its own Yahoo fetch and cron — the annual slice stores the *same* `earnings_estimate`/`revenue_estimate` consensus, so the forward consensus has one source of truth (the FY1 low/high range and analyst counts were dropped with the table; the entities keep the full block, feeding `forward_pe`, the growth block, and the Bedrock analysis context)
- `adapters/yfinance_recommendations_adapter.py` — live source for the recommendations slice: **Yahoo via `yfinance`** (`Ticker.recommendations` + `Ticker.analyst_price_targets`), the sell-side buy/hold/sell split as monthly snapshots (the same recommendation-trend data Finnhub serves, but keyless — this replaced `finnhub_recommendation_provider.py` and the `FINNHUB_API_KEY` gate on the endpoint) **plus** the current consensus price target (mean/high/low/median), attached to the returned run as best-effort enrichment (a separate cheap read whose failure never sinks the trends). Yahoo labels the rows *relatively* (`0m` = this month, `-1m`, …), so the adapter anchors them on today's month into first-of-month `period` dates — the identity the DB cache keys on. `adapters/db_cached_recommendations_adapter.py` — the same **read-through** DB cache as the earnings slices (DB-first, fetch-on-miss, no TTL/serve-stale)
- `adapters/yfinance_rating_changes_adapter.py` — live source for the upgrade/downgrade feed: **Yahoo via `yfinance`** (`Ticker.upgrades_downgrades`), keyless, implementing the recommendations slice's `RatingChangeProvider` port. The sell-side's individual rating actions (firm, date, from/to grade, action, old/new price target) — the discrete events behind the monthly trend. Keeps only the most recent 50 of Yahoo's full multi-year log; drops firmless/undated/duplicate rows; coerces Yahoo's `0.0` "no target" to `None`. Stored **insert-only** into the sibling `stock_analyst_rating_changes` table by `SqlRatingChangesRepository`, and fetched in the **same** recommendations sweep (not a second anchor pass)
- `adapters/yfinance_news_adapter.py` — live source for the news slice: **Yahoo via `yfinance`** (`Ticker.news`), a stock's recent headlines, keyless. Recent yfinance nests each item under `content` (`title`, `summary`, `pubDate`, `contentType` STORY/VIDEO, `provider.displayName`, `canonicalUrl`/`clickThroughUrl`, `thumbnail.originalUrl`); the top-level `id` (Yahoo's UUID) is the identity the DB cache keys and dedupes on. An article missing an id/title/parseable publish-time is dropped (nothing to key or order on); everything past those three is best-effort and left `None` when absent. `adapters/db_cached_news_adapter.py` — the same **read-through** DB cache as the earnings/recommendations slices (DB-first, fetch-on-miss, no TTL/serve-stale)
- `adapters/sec_edgar_revenue_segments_adapter.py` — live source for the revenue-segments slice: **SEC EDGAR** (`SecEdgarRevenueSegmentsProvider`), **keyless**, implementing `RevenueSegmentsProvider`. Walks ticker → CIK (`company_tickers.json`) → latest 10-K (`submissions`) → the filing's `_htm.xml` XBRL instance, and parses the dimensioned revenue facts into `RevenueSegment` entities on three axes (`StatementBusinessSegmentsAxis` → business, `ProductOrServiceAxis` → product, `StatementGeographicalAxis` → geography). Only *annual-duration* facts count (the quarterly facts a 10-K also carries are dropped by a ≥350-day period filter); the consolidated total (no member) is excluded. `_aggregate_axis` is the crux: it takes both **flat** single-axis facts (Apple's `iPhoneMember`) and **segment-nested** two-axis facts (Google's product members tagged under both `ProductOrServiceAxis` *and* the segment axis — summed across segments to the product total), which a naive single-axis filter would drop entirely. Prefers the most-specific revenue concept (`RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax` > … > `Revenues`) on a duplicate. Sends a descriptive `User-Agent` (SEC asks) and **paces** its requests (`min_request_interval_seconds`, set by the wiring) under EDGAR's ~10 req/s ceiling — SEC welcomes data-centre IPs, so no IP-block retry machinery (unlike the Yahoo sources). `_parse_revenue_segments` is a pure function the tests drive on a canned instance; `_http` is the fake seam. `adapters/db_cached_revenue_segments_adapter.py` — the same **read-through** DB cache as the earnings/recommendations/news slices (DB-first, fetch-on-miss, no TTL/serve-stale)
- `adapters/db_only_context_providers.py` — DB-only (no live fall-through) views of the quarterly / annual / recommendations caches, used **only by the AI-analysis path**. Each wraps the slice's persistence repository and implements the slice's *provider* port, serving stored rows and returning an **empty** timeline on a miss (never a live fetch). The read endpoints keep the read-through `db_cached_*` adapters (a miss there *should* fetch); the analysis path swaps in these so best-effort context can't add a synchronous, rate-limited Yahoo round-trip to a user request. Keeping the caches current stays the crons' job
- `analysis/db_repository.py` (the tiny `analysis/` sub-slice) — `SqlInvestmentAnalysisCache`, the **read-through result cache** behind *both* AI-analysis endpoints, over the `investment_analysis_cache` table (migration 0022; one row per `(kind, symbol)`, `kind` ∈ `stock`/`etf` so a stock and a fund sharing a ticker never collide). The use case returns a stored read while it's within `ANALYSIS_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES` of its `generated_at`, else regenerates and upserts. Best-effort both ways (a read failure is a miss, a write failure is swallowed), so it only ever makes the endpoint faster, never wrong. Deliberately **not** a `stocks` child — an analysis is served for any valid ticker, and forcing an anchor row per analysed symbol would leak arbitrary tickers into the screened universe (so it stands alone, like `etfs`)
- `adapters/yfinance_options_adapter.py` — live source for the ticker card's `options_metrics` block: **Yahoo via `yfinance`** (`Ticker.options` for the expiration list, `Ticker.option_chain(date)` for one expiry's calls/puts), keyless, implementing the ticker slice's `OptionChainProvider` port. Maps chain rows → `OptionContract` entities (strike, bid/ask/last, volume, open interest, IV); every *derived* figure (ATM IV, expected move, insurance cost, put/call) is entity logic, not adapter logic. **No DB cache or cron** — options prices decay by the hour, so the no-TTL read-through pattern doesn't fit; the read is live per request (the endpoint's 5-min Cache-Control is the only damping) and best-effort even when requested, since Yahoo intermittently blocks data-centre IPs
- `adapters/wikipedia_index_membership_adapter.py` — live source for the index-membership slice: **Wikipedia** (`List_of_S&P_500_companies` + `Nasdaq-100`) via `httpx` + `pandas.read_html`, implementing `IndexMembershipSource`. **Keyless** — this replaced Finnhub's `/index/constituents`, which is a **paid** capability the deployed key `403`'d on; Wikipedia welcomes data-centre-IP reads (works from Fargate where Yahoo/Nasdaq/ETF-issuer endpoints block us), so the wiring is now always-constructable like the universe sweep (no `FINNHUB_API_KEY`, no 503 gate). Parses by **column signature** — reads every table and keeps the one whose flat `Symbol`/`Ticker` column yields the most tickers — so each page's *changes* log (S&P "Selected changes", Nasdaq "Component changes") is ignored, directly fixing the bug that sank the **earlier** Wikipedia attempt (it grabbed the Nasdaq-100 change-log table). Sends a descriptive `User-Agent` (Wikipedia asks). Fetches each page independently, normalizes tickers to the anchor's convention (`BRK.B` → `BRK-B`), and returns the two ticker sets; a single page's failure (transport / non-200 / unparseable body) degrades to empty (the other still syncs), both failing raises `StockDataUnavailable`. Same fake-`_http` seam the other adapters use for offline tests. (The earlier abandoned attempt is what the docstring's caution refers to; the issuer-ETF/Yahoo routes remain blocked from data-centre IPs — Wikipedia is the one that isn't.)
- `adapters/yfinance_screener_adapter.py` — live source for the universe slice: **Yahoo via `yfinance`** (`yf.screen` + `EquityQuery`), the ≥$1B US screen (`ScreenedStock` per row) written onto the `stocks` anchor. Each screen quote also carries the `regularMarketPrice`, which the adapter keeps (positive only) on `ScreenedStock.price` — not persisted itself, but the price leg the sync's valuation pass pairs with the quarterly TTM to derive the stored `pe_ratio`
- `adapters/yfinance_etf_screener_adapter.py` — live source for the ETF slice's bulk screen: **Yahoo via `yfinance`** (`yf.screen` with a *custom* `ETFQuery` — `region == us` and `fundnetassets >= min_net_assets`, ranked by AUM), the US ETFs at/above an AUM floor (`ScreenedEtf` per row — AUM + expense ratio) written into the slice's own `etfs` table. Screens the full US ETF universe by AUM the way `yfinance_screener_adapter` screens stocks by market cap — the floor (`SyncEtfs.MIN_NET_ASSETS`, **$1B**, ~1,000 funds) is a use-case constant passed into the port, the exact `MIN_MARKET_CAP` pattern. (This replaced Yahoo's *predefined* `top_etfs_us` screen — a fixed curated ~540-fund list that couldn't be widened; the old "`FundQuery` has no net-assets field" limitation was the *mutual-fund* query, but the ETF query carries `fundnetassets`, so it filters **and** ranks by AUM.) Every row carries `netAssets`, so the read side sorts by AUM. Carries no category or profile — that's the per-ticker enrichment pass's job (`EtfProfileProvider`). Drops a stray non-fund row (`quoteType` present and not `ETF`) the broad US screen can surface, so the table holds only funds. Folds `PCX` (NYSE Arca — the primary ETF venue the stock screen never sees) into `NYSE`, its parent, so `exchange` stays inside the same `NASDAQ`/`NYSE`/`AMEX`/`BATS` vocabulary the stock screen uses (migration 0018 backfilled the earlier `NYSEARCA` rows, since `exchange` is written fill-once)
- `adapters/yfinance_etf_profile_adapter.py` — the ETF slice's per-ticker **profile** enrichment, implementing `EtfProfileProvider`: **Yahoo via `yfinance`**, reading `Ticker.info` (category, `fundFamily`, `navPrice`, `yield`, the trailing-return ladder) + `Ticker.funds_data` (description, `top_holdings`, `sector_weightings`), keyless. The bulk screen carries none of this (Yahoo publishes it only per-ticker), so the sync fetches it a fund at a time and **persists** it — the scalars onto the `etfs` row, the two lists into the `etf_sector_weightings` / `etf_top_holdings` child tables — and the detail endpoint serves that stored profile from the DB. **One exception: the trailing-return ladder (ytd/3y/5y) is fetched but no longer persisted** (migration 0021 dropped those columns) — only the detail card's `performance` block surfaces the 3y/5y, so the read path fetches them **live** from this same adapter when that block is requested (best-effort, the sole live Yahoo call on the ETF read path), rather than storing a snapshot that drifts between syncs. One fetch per fund covers everything, so this **subsumed the old single-column category adapter** (`yfinance_etf_category_adapter`, removed) — category rides the same `.info` blob. Per-field unit normalization to human percent (Yahoo mixes fractions and already-percent numbers; verified against VOO), and the shared `yfinance_session` crumb-401 retry like the stock classifier. Contract: **raises `StockDataUnavailable` on a hard `.info` read** (a raised error or an empty-after-retry `.info` — the block signal, so the sync skips + retries the fund and leaves its stored profile intact), best-effort past that (a served-but-sparse fund, or a failed `funds_data`, yields a partial profile)
- `stocks/models.py` — the shared `stocks` anchor as its own tiny slice (`app/stocks/stocks/`): owns the `StockRecord` model (the `stocks` table — `ticker` (unique lookup; the column was renamed from `symbol` by migration 0010 — the domain layers still say "symbol"), the fill-once identity facts `name` and `exchange`, and the mutable `revenue_growth_yoy` / `eps_growth_yoy` **latest trailing YoY snapshot** (migration 0011 — percent; EPS on the analyst-consensus/adjusted basis; **overwritten** every refresh by the annual-earnings slice as the newest reported year rolls forward, unlike the fill-once facts) and their **forward** counterparts `forward_revenue_growth_yoy` / `forward_eps_growth_yoy` (migration 0018 — the analyst-consensus FY1→FY2 change, feeding the universe search's forward-growth sorts and the AI analysis context; written the same way by the annual slice from its stored forward years, both legs on the consensus basis; more often null since they need *two* upcoming years), the universe screen facts `sector` / `industry` / `market_cap` / `screened_at` (migration 0012; `industry` added by 0013), the `in_sp500` / `in_nasdaq100` index-membership flags (migration 0014 — `NOT NULL`, default `False`; reconciled by the index-membership slice: current members marked, drop-outs cleared), and the `pe_ratio` trailing-P/E snapshot (migration 0017 — the consensus-basis figure the ticker card computes live, materialized for search sorting; **overwritten** every run by the universe sync's valuation pass, like `market_cap`, and null until four quarters are cached or on a trailing loss)) and its helpers `get_or_create_stock`, `anchor_facts`, `fill_exchange`. Owned by no single feature; per-feature tables hang off it and import it from here

Naming: `<vendor>_<concern>_provider.py` for the flat adapters; `<vendor>_<concern>_adapter.py` for those under `app/stocks/adapters/` — and a vendor-specific subfolder drops the now-redundant vendor prefix (the Bedrock analysers are `app/stocks/adapters/bedrock/<concern>_adapter.py`, e.g. `analysis_adapter.py`). **"Provider" vs "adapter" is not a difference in kind** — both are Interface-Adapter-layer port implementations. The file *suffix* is only a folder convention; the *class* keeps the name of the **port** it implements — a live-feed port is a `*Provider`, static reference data a `*Repository` — so e.g. `BedrockAnalysisProvider` (in `analysis_adapter.py`) implements the `InvestmentAnalysisProvider` port.

> America` and `KeyBanc` never onto `KBW`) with each one's current stance (rating + target), derived
> from the rating-change events, most credible first. A sibling **AI review** at

> (`adapters/yfinance_recommendations_adapter.py`) — this replaced Finnhub's

> (`POST /internal/recommendations/sync`, driven by the **daily** `sync-recommendations`

> columns), a time series unique on `stock_id` + `period` (first-of-month). **One deliberate
> divergence from the earnings slices: the upsert *merges* instead of rewriting** — it
> replaces the months the source served and keeps earlier stored months, because a past
> month's split is a frozen fact and Yahoo serves only ~4 months at once, so the table
> accumulates a longer history than the source. Consequently `refresh_targets` orders
> staleness by the **max** `fetched_at` per stock (the last refresh), not the min — the
> merge keeps ancient stamps on old months forever. The sync still skips an empty live
> result (nothing to merge; the stock's refresh stamp must not stall the stale queue).
> Caveat: the derived `period` is only as true as the relative labels — a symbol fetched
> near a month boundary can label a snapshot one month off; cosmetic, same spirit as the
> earnings slices' calendar-derived fiscal labels.

> **The revenue-segments sub-slice — `app/stocks/revenue_segments/`.** *What* a company makes

> drops the whole product cut — `_aggregate_axis` handles both flat facts (Apple's `iPhoneMember`,
> single-axis) and segment-nested ones (Google's `GoogleSearchOtherMember` inside a segment,
> summed across segments to the product total). Serial sync (no thread pool) + adapter request
> pacing keep it under EDGAR's ~10 req/s ask; SEC welcomes data-centre IPs (works from Fargate
> where Yahoo blocks us), so no IP-block retry machinery. **Members are the filer's own labels** —
> comparable within a company over time but **not aggregatable across companies** (there's no
> cross-company segment taxonomy, the way there is for sectors); and a filer's product members can
> include *subtotals* it defines (e.g. Google's advertising subtotal over Search+YouTube+Network),
> so the axis's values aren't a clean partition. Best-effort throughout: a single-segment or
> foreign (20-F) filer with no disaggregation is a 200 with an empty list, not a 404.

> **The ticker sub-slice — `app/stocks/ticker/`.** A stock's **ticker card** at

> **DB-first identity facts** — `name` (from the Finnhub profile) and `exchange` (from
> the Alpaca full snapshot) — each lazily filled **once** per symbol into the `stocks`
> anchor (`name` was always on it; `exchange` came with migration 0009) and served from
> the row forever after, since neither effectively ever changes (a rebrand needs a

> read/fill, no slice-owned table), and the **read-only anchor facts** the card just
> serves off the same row — `market_cap` / `sector` / `industry` (the universe screen's
> facts) — all but the quote best-effort and `null` until their sync reaches the stock
> (e.g. a symbol not yet screened has no market cap; unlike the old behaviour, the card
> no longer falls back to Finnhub for it). One anchor read (`models.anchor_facts`, a
> `Row` mapped into `StoredTickerFacts`) serves all of them plus the growth pair below.
> **Opt-in blocks** via `?include=` (repeated or comma-separated;

> never the card. Beside it: the **cash-flow reads** `price_to_fcf` + `fcf_yield` +
> `ocf_yield` — live price ÷ the annual-earnings slice's stored trailing `fcf_per_share` /
> `ocf_per_share` (the newest reported year's free/operating cash flow per share, off the

> `fcf_yield` / `ocf_yield` keep their sign (a negative yield is a real "burning cash" read);

> runs well above its FCF yield). All three ride the **anchor read** (not the fundamentals
> call), so a keyless/blocked Finnhub still serves them — `null` only until the annual slice has
> reached the stock. And: `gross_margin`/`operating_margin`/`net_margin` (off the fundamentals
> call). `trailing_pe`/`price_to_fcf`/`fcf_yield`/`ocf_yield` are the computed fields on the
> slice-local `TickerValuation` entity; the entity's `symbol` is renamed `ticker` at the DTO.
> The `metrics` block also carries the **latest trailing YoY growth** —
> `revenue_growth_yoy` + `eps_growth_yoy` + `fcf_growth_yoy` (percent, EPS on the consensus
> basis, FCF on a per-share basis) — read straight off the `stocks` anchor where the annual

> cached. The **universe search** materializes `fcf_yield` onto the anchor too (its valuation
> pass divides the stored `fcf_per_share` into the screen-time price, the same way it derives
> `pe_ratio`), so the search list is sortable by cash cheapness (`sort=fcf_yield`).
> `options_metrics` is what the options market *believes* about the stock, for a buyer

### 5. DTOs — `app/stocks/schemas.py`
Pydantic `BaseModel`s for HTTP responses. Pydantic is a serialization detail, so
DTOs live at the edge, deliberately **separate from entities** — that's what
keeps the core framework-agnostic. JSON-shape concerns (field aliases like
`1w`/`3m`) belong here, not on the entity.

### 6. Router — `app/stocks/router.py`
The **composition root**. Three jobs:
- **Controller** — each `@router.get` endpoint unpacks the request, calls
  `use_case.execute(...)`, and maps domain exceptions → HTTP status.
- **Presenter** — `_present_*` functions turn the returned entity into a DTO.
- **Wiring** — `get_*` factory functions read env vars and build providers
  (`@lru_cache` for singletons), injected via FastAPI `Depends`.

### 7. Exceptions — `app/stocks/exceptions.py`
Domain errors in business terms, independent of HTTP and vendors:
`StockNotFound`, `StockDataUnavailable`. Adapters raise them; the router
translates them.

---

## Core patterns (follow these)

**Primary data vs. best-effort enrichment.** Decide which a new data source is:
- *Primary* (the endpoint's reason to exist, e.g. price, earnings history): the
  provider is required, errors **propagate** to the endpoint, and a missing API
  key is a hard **503** in the wiring.
- *Enrichment* (nice-to-have, e.g. market cap, company name, next-report): the
  provider is typed `| None`, the use case wraps the call in
  `try/except (StockNotFound, StockDataUnavailable): return None`, and a missing
  key just makes the provider `None` and silently omits the field. **Enrichment
  must never sink the primary response.**

**Exception → HTTP translation** (done in the endpoint, uniformly):

| Raised | HTTP |
|--------|------|
| `ValueError` (bad/again-normalized input) | 400 |
| `StockNotFound` | 404 |
| `StockDataUnavailable` | 502 |
| missing required API key (in a `get_*` factory) | 503 |

**Config & secrets** come from environment variables, read only in the router's
wiring functions (`APCA_API_KEY_ID`, `FINNHUB_API_KEY`, `LOGODEV_TOKEN`,
`DATABASE_URL`, `CRON_SYNC_TOKEN`; the Bedrock analysers add `BEDROCK_REGION` /
`BEDROCK_ANALYSIS_MODEL_ID` — plus per-analyser model overrides like
`BEDROCK_EARNINGS_ANALYSIS_MODEL_ID` / `BEDROCK_RATINGS_ANALYSIS_MODEL_ID`, and the AI screener's
`BEDROCK_SCREENER_MODEL_ID` — and the analysis
result cache adds the optional `ANALYSIS_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES`, default 30). The `/internal/*/sync` cron endpoints are guarded
by a shared bearer token: each `@router.post` depends on `require_cron_token`
(`app/stocks/endpoints/cron_auth.py`), which requires `Authorization: Bearer
$CRON_SYNC_TOKEN` (constant-time compared) and is **fail-closed** — a `503` when the token is
unset, a `401` on a missing/wrong token. The GitHub sync workflows don't hit this HTTP surface
(they run the sweeps as one-off ECS tasks via `python -m app.sync`, which call the `run_*_sync`
runners directly), so the guard only gates a manual/HTTP trigger. Build
providers lazily so the app boots without every key. Never hardcode or commit
secrets.

**Input normalization** happens once, at the top of the use case
(`_normalize_symbol`), so every layer below sees clean input.

---

## "Where does this go?"

| You're adding… | Put it in |
|----------------|-----------|
| A new concept / a calculation that's a fact about one object | an **entity** (`entities.py`), as a field or `@property` |
| A pure calculation over a price series (no I/O) | a domain helper like `indicators.py` |
| A new action/workflow (validate → fetch → assemble) | a **use case** class in `use_cases.py` |
| A need for data the use case can't compute itself | a new **port** in `ports.py` |
| A call to a third-party API or the database | an **adapter** implementing that port |
| A new field/shape in the JSON response | a **DTO** in `schemas.py` + its `_present_*` mapper |
| A new HTTP route | an **endpoint** + wiring in `router.py` |
| A reusable domain error | `exceptions.py` |

---

## Adding a feature — work inward to outward

1. **Entity** — model the data and its intrinsic rules in `entities.py`.
2. **Port** — declare the interface the use case needs in `ports.py` (returns
   entities, raises domain exceptions).
3. **Use case** — write the `execute()` orchestration in `use_cases.py`, depending
   only on the entity + port.
4. **Adapter** — implement the port against the real vendor/DB in a
   `*_provider.py`; map vendor models → entities and vendor errors → domain
   exceptions.
5. **DTO + presenter** — add the response model in `schemas.py` and a `_present_*`
   in `router.py`.
6. **Endpoint + wiring** — add the route and the `Depends`/`@lru_cache` factory
   in `router.py`; translate exceptions to HTTP.
7. **Test** — drive the use case with a **fake** implementing the port; assert the
   endpoint via `TestClient` with the fake injected through `app.dependency_overrides`.

---

## Testing

Everything runs **offline**. The clean layering is what makes that possible: tests
inject a hand-written `FakeProvider` (implementing the port) instead of mocking
the network or the vendor SDK. Tests use in-memory SQLite and ignore
`DATABASE_URL`. Mirror this — if a test needs the network, the seam is in the
wrong place.

```

---

## Commands

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # install (add ".[postgres]" for the RDS driver)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # run locally (docs at /docs)
alembic upgrade head             # apply migrations (schema is Alembic-owned, not create_all)
pytest                           # run the offline test suite
```

To change the DB schema: edit the relevant model (e.g. the shared anchor
`app/stocks/stocks/models.py`, or a slice's `models.py`), then
`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "…"`, review the generated migration, and
`alembic upgrade head`.

> **Keep the migration `revision` id ≤ 32 chars.** Alembic's `alembic_version.version_num`
> column is `VARCHAR(32)`. SQLite ignores the length so an over-long id passes the local
> tests, but Postgres (RDS) enforces it and the deploy's `alembic upgrade head` fails with
> `value too long for type character varying(32)`. Follow the existing short ids
> (`000N_<concern>`), not the verbose file name.

## Hard rules

- **Never violate the dependency rule.** No vendor import outside its adapter; no
  adapter/framework import inside an entity or use case.
- **`main` is protected** — branch and open a PR; never push to `main`.
- **Never commit secrets** — keys come from env vars (SSM in AWS).
- **Schema is Alembic-owned** — never `create_all`; migrate.
