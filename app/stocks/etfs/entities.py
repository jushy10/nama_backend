"""Entities: the top-ETFs view of a US exchange-traded fund.

Slice-local domain objects (this sub-slice keeps its own ``entities`` rather than reaching
into the shared ``app/stocks/entities.py`` or the stock ``universe`` slice's — the same
convention as the earnings and recommendations sub-slices). Pure and vendor-agnostic —
stdlib only.

``ScreenedEtf`` is one row of what the *bulk screen* carries: the identity facts (``ticker`` /
``name`` / ``exchange``) alongside ``net_assets`` (assets under management, the ETF analogue of
a stock's market cap and the natural "top" ranking) and ``expense_ratio``. The fund's
``category`` is deliberately *not* on it — the bulk screen doesn't publish one, exactly like the
stock screen carries no sector — so it's filled separately by the sync's per-fund enrichment
pass (which reads it off the same ``EtfProfile`` as the rest of the fund's profile).

The read side (``GET /stocks/etfs`` + ``GET /stocks/etfs/categories``) adds the shapes the
search flows through: ``EtfSearchCriteria`` (a normalized query — free text, a ``category``
filter, an ``EtfSort`` field with a ``SortDirection`` and a limit/offset page), the
``EtfSearchResult`` rows it matches wrapped in an ``EtfSearchPage`` (carrying the total match
count for pagination), and ``EtfCategories`` (the distinct category slugs the FE offers as a
filter menu). All pure value objects — the SQL that reads them lives in the adapter, the
normalization in the use case.

    percent here in the domain's vocabulary (the adapter owns the vendor's unit quirks):
    ``dividend_yield``, ``ytd_return``, ``three_year_return`` and ``five_year_return`` are
