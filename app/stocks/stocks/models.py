"""Database model + queries for the shared ``stocks`` anchor.

The ``stocks`` table is the single row every per-feature table (the earnings
timelines, …) points at, so the same stock is one thing everyone references rather than
a symbol string copied around. It's owned by no single feature, so it gets its own slice
here. Feature slices import ``StockRecord`` + ``get_or_create_stock`` and add their own
child tables beside it. The schema is created by migration 0002 (the since-removed
analyst-estimates feature was the first to need the anchor); migration 0009 added
``exchange`` and 0010 renamed the ``symbol`` column to ``ticker`` (the domain layers
still say "symbol" — the rename is a table-vocabulary choice).
