"""Abstract persistence port for the universe slice.

Dependency Inversion for storage: the sync use case is handed a ``UniverseRepository`` and
never knows whether it's backed by SQLAlchemy or an in-memory fake (tests) — it just calls
``upsert_screen``. The concrete SQLAlchemy implementation lives in ``db_repository.py``.

A *Repository*, not a *Provider*: the universe is a slow-moving set refreshed out of band
(the cron endpoint), not a live feed. It writes the screen straight onto the ``stocks``
anchor (ticker/name/exchange plus the denormalized ``sector``/``market_cap``/``screened_at``
columns) — there is no separate universe table.

Two ports, split by capability (the ``CLAUDE.md`` "one port per capability" rule): the
write side ``UniverseRepository`` the sync uses, and the read side ``StockSearchRepository``
the ``GET /stocks/ticker`` search + ``GET /stocks/classifications`` endpoints use. Kept
separate so the sync's fake never grows search methods and vice versa — they just happen to
front the same ``stocks`` anchor.
