"""Abstract persistence port for the recommendations slice.

The interface the use cases depend on — Dependency Inversion for storage. A use case is
handed a ``RecommendationsRepository`` and never knows whether it's backed by SQLAlchemy,
an in-memory fake (tests), or anything else; it just calls these methods. The concrete
SQLAlchemy implementation lives in ``db_repository.py``, over the models and queries in
``models.py``.

A *Repository*, not a *Provider*: the rows are slow-moving monthly snapshots refreshed
out of band (the cron endpoint) and lazily on a miss, not a live feed. Caching yfinance
this way keeps the endpoint off Yahoo, which rate-limits data-centre IPs.
